## About The Project

![cover](assets/about.png)

 Sandstone provides Layer-0 intent settlement infrastructure - Built on Anthropic's Model Context Protocol, we handle orderflow execution, cross-chain bridging, swaps, and transaction management so developers don't have to
Deploy master agents with specialized MCP tools - Our intelligent agents automatically invoke the right tools for specific actions like sending transactions, bridging assets, or executing swaps with guaranteed settlement
Enable rapid application development - Cut development time from months to days by abstracting away foundational complexity, letting developers focus purely on business logic and user experience
Offer native integrations out-of-the-box - Seamlessly connect with payment gateways (credit cards, UPI), ENS for contact management, voice interfaces, and bank accounts to maximize user onboarding and accessibility

## Constituents

SandStone is made up of following components:

- **MCP Subgraphs**
- **React Native**
- **Onchain Ramp**
-
## Problems We Solve

Infrastructure complexity - Developers waste months building basic transaction handling, cross-chain bridging, and settlement logic instead of focusing on their core business features
Execution uncertainty - Applications struggle with unreliable transaction success rates, failed swaps, and unpredictable orderflow, creating poor user experiences
Integration overhead - Building native support for payment gateways, ENS, contacts, and voice interfaces requires extensive development work across multiple domains
User onboarding friction - Traditional crypto apps have steep learning curves, but you enable seamless experiences through familiar interfaces like voice commands and existing payment methods
